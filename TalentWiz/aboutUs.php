            TalentWiz is a web based application to provide online assistance in creating, conducting and
            evaluating examinations. Using this application, an organization can centralize the examination process (as
            better and faster way) which will be used for the manpower selection criteria of trainee/experienced
            employee. To achieve timely & accurate delivery of the web application (TalentWiz), it is divided into modules
            so that the whole team simultaneously work on the whole project and tests it separately. The challenge is to
            decide about the environment & implementation of the application, so that it will be cost effective as well as
            socially adaptable in the environment. The idea behind to set the environment in the broader sense, for
            looking into the aspects of hardware and software requirement which is costly enough for the common man.
